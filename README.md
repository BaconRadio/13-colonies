# Install Instructions (Dev Enviroment)

Yarn is the official package manager for this project. Although npm can also be used it is not suported and pull request that effect compatibility with yarn will be denyed.

## Yarn

*install instructions go here*

## Npm

To install the develoupment enviroment with npm run:
```shell
npm install
```

npm ci cannot be used as it requires a package-lock file not created by yarn. This limitation is the reasoning for npm not being supported for pull requests.

To start the app run:
```shell
npm run start
```

This will open the eletron app for testing so that changes can be previewed without building the application.
